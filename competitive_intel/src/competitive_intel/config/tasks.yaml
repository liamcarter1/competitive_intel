evaluate_quality:
  description: >
    You are evaluating two competitive intelligence deliverables produced for
    {company} in the {industry} industry (competitors: {competitors}).

    Evaluate each deliverable against its rubric below. Be strict on structure
    and specificity but fair on content depth — outputs that meet a professional
    bar should pass even if imperfect.

    === ANALYSIS RUBRIC ===
    The analysis MUST contain:
    1. Three clearly labeled audience sections: Engineering, Sales, and Strategy
    2. Urgency ratings (immediate / short-term / long-term) on findings
    3. Specific evidence from the scan (competitor names, product names, dates)
    4. A cross-cutting "Key Patterns" section with 3-5 significant trends

    Fail the analysis if any of these are missing or if the content is mostly
    generic industry observations without competitor-specific evidence.

    === RECOMMENDATIONS RUBRIC ===
    The recommendations MUST contain:
    1. 12-20 recommendations organized by function (Engineering, Sales, Strategy)
    2. Each recommendation cites specific competitive evidence
    3. Each recommendation has impact rating, difficulty rating, and timeline
    4. A "Top 5 Priorities" summary at the top

    Fail the recommendations if there are fewer than 12 recommendations, if
    the function organization is missing, if ratings/timelines are absent from
    most recommendations, or if the Top 5 Priorities section is missing.

    === CROSS-CUTTING CHECKS ===
    - Named competitors, specific products, and dates should appear throughout
    - Claims should be backed by evidence, not vague assertions
    - Recommendations should be actionable (a team could act on them next quarter)

    === DELIVERABLES TO EVALUATE ===

    ANALYSIS:
    {analysis}

    RECOMMENDATIONS:
    {recommendations}

    Evaluate each deliverable and respond with ONLY a JSON object (no markdown
    fences, no extra text):
  expected_output: >
    A JSON object with exactly two keys:

    "evaluation_result": one of "pass", "fail_analysis", "fail_recommendations",
    or "fail_both"

    "evaluation_feedback": a string with specific feedback. If passing, briefly
    note strengths. If failing, list the specific gaps that must be fixed,
    referencing the rubric criteria above. Be concrete — say "missing Key
    Patterns section" not "could be improved".

    Example pass: {{"evaluation_result": "pass", "evaluation_feedback": "Both
    deliverables meet the rubric. Analysis covers all three audiences with
    urgency ratings and a strong Key Patterns section. Recommendations include
    16 items with proper ratings and a clear Top 5."}}

    Example fail: {{"evaluation_result": "fail_recommendations",
    "evaluation_feedback": "Recommendations has only 9 items (minimum 12).
    Missing Top 5 Priorities section. Engineering recommendations lack
    difficulty ratings and timelines."}}

    Conduct a deep-dive investigation into {competitor} in the {industry}
    industry as of {current_date}.

    SOURCE PRIORITY (use in this order):

    - Do not use the same source more than 3 times across the entire report —
      seek diverse sources for a well-rounded picture.
